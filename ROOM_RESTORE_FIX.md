# Room Restore on App Resume - Fix Documentation

## Problem
When the app went to background (device standby or app switched), and then resumed, users were always returned to the room list instead of the room they were viewing.

**Update 1**: Initial fix caused a double navigation issue where the room would flash briefly before being replaced by the room list.

**Update 2**: After fixing the double navigation, users could navigate to the saved room but couldn't leave it (back button showed endless spinner). The WebSocket wasn't connected yet when navigating to the room.

**Update 3**: After fixing the WebSocket timing, users could navigate to the room and use it normally, but pressing back showed endless spinner. This was because the app navigated directly from `auth_check` to `room_timeline`, skipping `room_list`, so the back stack was wrong.

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Room ID Not Saved
The app's state saving mechanism (`saveStateToStorage()`) was saving:
- WebSocket connection state (run_id, last_received_sync_id)
- Room list data
- **BUT NOT** the currently open room ID

When the app resumed, `loadStateFromStorage()` restored the room list and WebSocket state, but had no information about which room was open.

### Issue 2: Double Navigation Trigger
After fixing Issue 1, a new problem appeared: the room would flash briefly before being replaced by the room list. This was caused by the navigation callback being triggered **twice**:

1. **First trigger**: When `setNavigationCallback()` is called in AuthCheck after cached state is loaded, it checks if `spacesLoaded` is true and triggers immediately → navigates to room
2. **Second trigger**: When WebSocket connects and receives `init_complete`, it calls `onInitComplete()` which triggers the callback again → navigates to room_list (because pending navigation was already cleared)

This race condition meant the first navigation was immediately overwritten by the second.

### Issue 3: WebSocket Not Connected When Navigating
After fixing Issue 2, a new problem appeared: users could navigate to the saved room but couldn't leave it (back button showed endless spinner). This was caused by navigating to the room **before** the WebSocket was connected:

**AuthCheck.kt execution order with cached state:**
1. Line 41: `loadStateFromStorage()` - sets `spacesLoaded = true`
2. Line 56: `setNavigationCallback()` - immediately triggers and navigates to room
3. RoomTimelineScreen loads and calls `requestRoomTimeline()` (needs WebSocket)
4. **Line 104**: `connectToWebsocket()` is finally called - **TOO LATE!**

The room screen was trying to load data before the WebSocket connection was established, causing all operations to hang.

### Issue 4: Incorrect Navigation Back Stack
After fixing Issue 3, users could navigate to the room and use it normally, but pressing back showed an endless spinner. This was caused by incorrect navigation back stack:

**Navigation flow with pending room:**
- `auth_check` → `room_timeline` (direct navigation, skipping `room_list`)

**Back stack:**
- `auth_check` (shows loading spinner)
- `room_timeline` (your room)

When pressing back from `room_timeline`, it goes back to `auth_check` which is still in loading state, showing the spinner forever.

**Correct back stack should be:**
- `auth_check`
- `room_list`
- `room_timeline`

So pressing back goes to `room_list` as expected.

## Solution
Modified `AppViewModel.kt` to save and restore the current room ID, and prevent double navigation triggers:

### Changes Made

#### Fix 1: Save/Restore Current Room

1. **In `saveStateToStorage()` (line 1272-1278)**:
   - Added code to save `currentRoomId` to SharedPreferences when a room is open
   - Removes the saved room ID when no room is open
   - Logs the saved room ID for debugging

2. **In `loadStateFromStorage()` (line 1385-1390)**:
   - Added code to restore the saved room ID from SharedPreferences
   - Uses the existing `setPendingRoomNavigation()` mechanism to schedule navigation back to that room
   - The pending navigation is handled by the existing `AuthCheck.kt` navigation callback

3. **In `clearCachedState()` (line 1433)**:
   - Added cleanup of `current_room_id` when clearing cache
   - Ensures no stale room navigation on logout or cache clear

#### Fix 2: Prevent Double Navigation

4. **Added `navigationCallbackTriggered` flag (line 933)**:
   - Boolean flag to track if the navigation callback has already been triggered
   - Prevents the callback from running multiple times

5. **Modified `onInitComplete()` (line 840-850)**:
   - Added check for `navigationCallbackTriggered` flag before invoking callback
   - Sets flag to true when triggering callback
   - Logs when callback is skipped due to already being triggered

6. **Modified `setNavigationCallback()` (line 970-974)**:
   - Added logic to trigger callback immediately if `spacesLoaded` is already true (from cached state)
   - Sets `navigationCallbackTriggered` flag when triggering
   - Prevents `onInitComplete()` from triggering again later

7. **Reset flag in `clearCachedState()` (line 1442)**:
   - Resets `navigationCallbackTriggered` to false when clearing cache
   - Ensures navigation works after logout/cache clear

#### Fix 3: Wait for WebSocket Before Navigating

8. **Modified `setNavigationCallback()` again (line 969-974)**:
   - Removed immediate trigger when `spacesLoaded` is true from cached state
   - Now logs "waiting for WebSocket connection before navigating"
   - Lets `onInitComplete()` handle the navigation after WebSocket connects
   - Ensures WebSocket is ready before navigating to the room

#### Fix 4: Proper Navigation Back Stack

9. **Modified `AuthCheck.kt` (line 83-100)**:
   - Changed to navigate to `room_list` first when there's a pending room navigation
   - Don't clear pending navigation in AuthCheck - let RoomListScreen handle it
   - This establishes proper back stack: `auth_check` → `room_list` → `room_timeline`
   - Error case still clears pending navigation and shows toast

10. **Added pending navigation check in `RoomListScreen.kt` (line 132-141)**:
    - Added `LaunchedEffect` to check for pending room navigation when screen loads
    - If pending room exists, clears it and navigates to `room_timeline`
    - This completes the navigation flow with proper back stack
    - User can now press back from room and return to room list

## How It Works

### On App Suspend:
1. User is viewing a room (e.g., `!room123:server.com`)
2. App goes to background (onPause → onAppBecameInvisible)
3. `saveStateToStorage()` is called
4. Current room ID is saved: `current_room_id = "!room123:server.com"`
5. After 15 seconds, WebSocket is shut down

### On App Resume (Final Correct Flow):
1. User returns to app (onResume → onAppBecameVisible)
2. `AuthCheck` calls `loadStateFromStorage()`
3. Room list and WebSocket state are restored
4. **Saved room ID is restored and set as pending navigation**
5. `spacesLoaded` is set to true (from cached data)
6. `setNavigationCallback()` is called in `AuthCheck`
7. Sees `spacesLoaded` is true but **does NOT trigger immediately**
8. Logs: "Spaces already loaded from cache, but waiting for WebSocket connection before navigating"
9. `connectToWebsocket()` is called (line 104 in AuthCheck)
10. **WebSocket connects to server**
11. Receives `init_complete` message from server
12. `onInitComplete()` is called
13. Checks `!navigationCallbackTriggered` - true (wasn't triggered in step 7)
14. Sets `navigationCallbackTriggered = true`
15. **Triggers navigation callback** (WebSocket is now connected!)
16. `AuthCheck` checks for pending room navigation - found!
17. **Navigates to `room_list` first** (to establish proper back stack)
18. Pending room navigation is NOT cleared yet
19. `RoomListScreen` loads
20. `LaunchedEffect` checks for pending room navigation - found!
21. Clears pending room navigation
22. **Navigates to `room_timeline/!room123:server.com`**
23. **Back stack is now: `auth_check` → `room_list` → `room_timeline`** ✅
24. **User is in the room and can press back to return to room list!** ✅

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Room open → Background → Resume**:
   - ✅ Should return to the same room

2. **Room list → Background → Resume**:
   - ✅ Should return to room list (no room ID saved)

3. **Room open → Background → Wait > 10 minutes → Resume**:
   - ⚠️ Cache is stale, performs full refresh
   - Room navigation may not be restored (intentional - data is too old)

4. **Logout → Login**:
   - ✅ Cache is cleared, no stale room navigation

## Log Messages Added

### When saving state:
```
AppViewModel: Saving current room ID: !room123:server.com
AppViewModel: Saved state to storage - run_id: ..., rooms: 11, currentRoom: !room123:server.com
```

### When restoring state (no immediate navigation):
```
AppViewModel: Restored 11 rooms from cache
AppViewModel: Restoring navigation to room: !room123:server.com
AppViewModel: Navigation callback set
AppViewModel: Spaces already loaded from cache, but waiting for WebSocket connection before navigating
```

### When WebSocket connects and navigation happens:
```
NetworkUtils: WebSocket connected
NetworkUtils: Received init_complete - initialization finished
AppViewModel: onInitComplete called - setting spacesLoaded = true
AppViewModel: Calling navigation callback (callback is set)
AuthCheck: Navigation callback triggered - navigating to room_list
AuthCheck: Navigation callback - pendingRoomId: !room123:server.com
AuthCheck: Navigating to pending room: !room123:server.com
AuthCheck: Room exists check - roomExists: true, roomId: !room123:server.com
AuthCheck: Room exists, navigating to room_list first (pending room will auto-navigate)
```

### When RoomListScreen loads and auto-navigates:
```
RoomListScreen: Detected pending room navigation to: !room123:server.com
RoomTimelineScreen: Loading timeline for room: !room123:server.com
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

This fix integrates seamlessly with existing mechanisms:
- Uses the existing `setPendingRoomNavigation()` function
- Works with the existing `AuthCheck` navigation callback
- Respects the existing cache staleness logic (10-minute threshold)
- Compatible with the existing shortcut/bubble navigation system

## No Breaking Changes

- Backward compatible: If `current_room_id` is not in SharedPreferences, the app behaves as before (returns to room list)
- No changes to public APIs
- No changes to navigation flow, just leverages existing pending navigation mechanism
- Flag-based solution is transparent to other components

## Summary

This fix resolves four critical issues:

1. **Missing room state persistence**: Now saves and restores `currentRoomId` to preserve user's location
2. **Double navigation race condition**: Prevents navigation callback from triggering twice using a `navigationCallbackTriggered` flag
3. **WebSocket not connected when navigating**: Delays navigation until WebSocket connects by not triggering immediately in `setNavigationCallback()` when cached state is loaded
4. **Incorrect navigation back stack**: Navigates through `room_list` first to establish proper back stack, so back button works correctly

The solution is minimal, non-invasive, and fully backward compatible. Users will now seamlessly return to the room they were viewing when the app resumes from background, with:
- ✅ No flashing or unwanted navigation
- ✅ WebSocket connected and ready before room loads
- ✅ Proper navigation back stack (`auth_check` → `room_list` → `room_timeline`)
- ✅ Back button returns to room list as expected
- ✅ Full functionality including timeline loading and message operations
