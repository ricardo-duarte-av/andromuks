# App Suspension Fixes

## Overview

Fixed two issues related to app suspension with the always-connected WebSocket:
1. **Removed obsolete WebSocket reconnect/disconnect logic** from notification actions
2. **Added timeline refresh** when resuming app with room open

## Issue 1: Obsolete Notification Action WebSocket Management

### Problem

With the foreground service keeping the WebSocket always connected, notification actions (reply from notification, mark as read) still had code to:
- Reconnect WebSocket if app was not visible
- Schedule shutdown 15 seconds after action completed
- Check WebSocket state and queue actions

**This was completely redundant** - the WebSocket is ALWAYS connected via the foreground service.

### Solution ✅

**Removed:**
- `notificationActionInProgress` flag
- `notificationActionShutdownTimer` Job
- `scheduleNotificationActionShutdown()` function
- All reconnect/disconnect logic from notification actions
- Cancellation code in `onAppBecameVisible()`

**Simplified:**
- `sendMessageFromNotification()` - Now just sends message directly (WebSocket maintained by service)
- `markRoomAsReadFromNotification()` - Now just marks read directly (WebSocket maintained by service)

### Code Changes

**app/src/main/java/net/vrkknn/andromuks/AppViewModel.kt:**

**Before:**
```kotlin
fun sendMessageFromNotification(roomId: String, text: String, onComplete: (() -> Unit)? = null) {
    if (webSocket == null || !spacesLoaded) {
        // Queue action
        pendingNotificationActions.add(...)
        
        // If app is not visible, reconnect websocket
        if (!isAppVisible) {
            notificationActionInProgress = true
            restartWebSocketConnection()  // ← Unnecessary!
        }
        return
    }
    
    sendWebSocketCommand("send_message", requestId, commandData)
    
    // Schedule shutdown if app is not visible
    if (!isAppVisible) {
        scheduleNotificationActionShutdown()  // ← Unnecessary!
    }
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
fun sendMessageFromNotification(roomId: String, text: String, onComplete: (() -> Unit)? = null) {
    if (webSocket == null || !spacesLoaded) {
        // Queue action (rare - only during startup)
        pendingNotificationActions.add(...)
        return
    }
    
    // WebSocket is ready (maintained by foreground service), send directly
    sendWebSocketCommand("send_message", requestId, commandData)
    
    // No shutdown needed - foreground service keeps WebSocket open
}
```

### Benefits

- ✅ **Simpler code** - Removed ~50 lines of unnecessary reconnect/shutdown logic
- ✅ **Faster notification actions** - No reconnect delay when replying from notifications
- ✅ **More reliable** - No race conditions with shutdown timers
- ✅ **Better battery** - No unnecessary reconnect/disconnect cycles

## Issue 2: Timeline Not Refreshing When App Resumes

### Problem

**Scenario:**
1. User has a room open in the app
2. Device suspends (screen off, or app goes to background)
3. New messages arrive → WebSocket receives them → Events cached via `sync_complete`
4. User resumes the app → **Timeline shows old messages, new ones are hidden!**

**Why it happened:**
- `sync_complete` messages add events to `RoomTimelineCache` ✅
- But `timelineEvents` StateFlow is NOT updated (UI doesn't recompose) ❌
- `RoomTimelineScreen` only reloads on `roomId` change, not on resume ❌

**Result:** Timeline is stale until you navigate away and back to the room.

### Solution ✅

Added a **refresh trigger mechanism** that reloads the timeline when app resumes with a room open.

#### How It Works

**1. Added `timelineRefreshTrigger` to AppViewModel:**
```kotlin
// Trigger for timeline refresh when app resumes (incremented when app becomes visible)
var timelineRefreshTrigger by mutableStateOf(0)
    private set
```

**2. Increment trigger in `onAppBecameVisible()`:**
```kotlin
fun onAppBecameVisible() {
    isAppVisible = true
    
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // If a room is currently open, trigger timeline refresh
    if (currentRoomId.isNotEmpty()) {
        Log.d("Andromuks", "Room is open ($currentRoomId), triggering timeline refresh")
        timelineRefreshTrigger++  // ← Trigger refresh
    }
}
```

**3. Watch trigger in RoomTimelineScreen:**
```kotlin
// Refresh timeline when app resumes (to show new events received while suspended)
LaunchedEffect(appViewModel.timelineRefreshTrigger) {
    if (appViewModel.timelineRefreshTrigger > 0 && appViewModel.currentRoomId == roomId) {
        Log.d("Andromuks", "App resumed, refreshing timeline for room: $roomId")
        // Don't reset state flags - this is just a refresh, not a new room load
        appViewModel.requestRoomTimeline(roomId)
    }
}
```

### Why This Works

**`requestRoomTimeline()` already checks cache:**
```kotlin
fun requestRoomTimeline(roomId: String) {
    // Check if we have enough cached events to skip paginate
    val cachedEvents = roomTimelineCache.getCachedEvents(roomId)
    if (cachedEvents != null) {
        // Use cached events for instant display!
        // Events that arrived during suspension are already here
        // ...
    } else {
        // No cache, issue paginate request
    }
}
```

**Result:**
- When app resumes, timeline reloads from cache
- Cache has new events from `sync_complete` messages received while suspended
- Timeline shows **all messages instantly** (no network request needed)
- User sees up-to-date conversation immediately

```

### Benefits

- ✅ **Timeline stays fresh** - New messages visible immediately on resume
- ✅ **Uses cache** - No network request needed (instant display)
- ✅ **Smart trigger** - Only refreshes if a room is actually open
- ✅ **Non-disruptive** - Doesn't reset scroll position or loading states
- ✅ **Works seamlessly** - User doesn't notice any delay or loading

### Code Changes

**Files Modified:**
1. `app/src/main/java/net/vrkknn/andromuks/AppViewModel.kt`
   - Added `timelineRefreshTrigger` state variable
   - Increment trigger in `onAppBecameVisible()` if room is open

2. `app/src/main/java/net/vrkknn/andromuks/RoomTimelineScreen.kt`
   - Added `LaunchedEffect(appViewModel.timelineRefreshTrigger)` to watch for resume events
   - Calls `requestRoomTimeline()` to reload from cache

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Notification Actions

**Steps:**
1. Put app in background
2. Receive message notification
3. Reply from notification
4. Check logs

**Expected:**
- ✅ "WebSocket maintained by service" in logs
- ✅ No "reconnecting websocket" messages
- ✅ No "scheduling shutdown" messages
- ✅ Reply sent immediately
- ✅ WebSocket stays connected

### Test Case 2: Timeline Refresh on Resume

**Steps:**
1. Open a room in the app
2. Put device to sleep or background the app
3. Send messages to that room from another device
4. Wait for sync_complete messages to arrive (check service notification lag)
5. Resume app

**Expected:**
- ✅ Timeline shows new messages immediately
- ✅ No loading spinner
- ✅ Scroll position preserved (if not at bottom)
- ✅ All messages in correct order
- ✅ Log shows "App resumed, refreshing timeline"

### Test Case 3: Room List Resume

**Steps:**
1. Leave app on room list screen
2. Background the app
3. Receive new messages
4. Resume app

**Expected:**
- ✅ Room list shows updated unread counts
- ✅ Rooms reordered by recent activity
- ✅ Message previews updated
- ✅ No timeline refresh triggered (no room open)

## Related Components

### Always-Connected WebSocket Architecture

**Foreground Service:**
- `WebSocketService` - Maintains notification, keeps app process alive
- `NetworkUtils.kt` - Manages actual WebSocket connection
- `AppViewModel` - Handles message processing

**Connection Lifecycle:**
1. App starts → `onInitComplete()` → Start `WebSocketService`
2. Service creates foreground notification → Process priority elevated
3. `NetworkUtils` connects WebSocket → Maintains connection
4. App suspends → WebSocket stays connected
5. App resumes → WebSocket already connected (no reconnect)
6. App killed → Service stops → WebSocket disconnects

**With these fixes:**
- Notification actions work immediately (no reconnect)
- Timeline stays fresh (auto-refresh on resume)
- Battery optimized (UI updates skipped when suspended)

## Benefits Summary

### Performance
- ✅ **Faster notification replies** - No reconnect delay
- ✅ **Instant timeline on resume** - Uses cache, no network request
- ✅ **Better battery life** - No unnecessary reconnect cycles

### Reliability
- ✅ **No race conditions** - Removed shutdown timer logic
- ✅ **Consistent state** - Timeline always shows latest messages
- ✅ **Simpler code** - Removed 50+ lines of unnecessary logic

### User Experience
- ✅ **Seamless resume** - Timeline updates automatically
- ✅ **No loading delays** - Cache provides instant display
- ✅ **Always up-to-date** - New messages visible immediately

## Implementation Notes

### Why Not Update timelineEvents Directly in sync_complete?

**Option 1: Update timelineEvents during sync_complete** (while suspended)
- ❌ Wastes battery (UI recomposition when screen is off)
- ❌ Unnecessary work (no one is looking at the timeline)
- ❌ Potential issues with Compose lifecycle

**Option 2: Cache events, reload on resume** (what we implemented)
- ✅ Battery efficient (no UI work while suspended)
- ✅ Simpler (cache is just a list, no chain management)
- ✅ Reliable (uses existing requestRoomTimeline flow)

### Why Use a Trigger Instead of watching isAppVisible?

**If we watched `isAppVisible` directly:**
```kotlin
LaunchedEffect(appViewModel.isAppVisible) {
    if (appViewModel.isAppVisible) {
        requestRoomTimeline(roomId)  // ← Fires every time room opens!
    }
}
```
- ❌ Would reload timeline on every room navigation
- ❌ Would reload when opening app to room list
- ❌ Inefficient and disruptive

**Using a trigger:**
```kotlin
LaunchedEffect(appViewModel.timelineRefreshTrigger) {
    // Only fires when trigger is explicitly incremented
}
```
- ✅ Only reloads when app resumes (not on navigation)
- ✅ Only if a room is actually open
- ✅ Explicit and controlled

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Differential Updates**
   - Instead of reloading entire timeline, diff cache vs current timeline
   - Only add new events, keep existing scroll position
   - More efficient for long timelines

2. **Resume Animation**
   - Animate in new messages when timeline refreshes
   - Visual indicator "X new messages" badge
   - Smoother UX for resume experience

3. **Smart Refresh**
   - Check if cache actually has new events before reloading
   - Skip refresh if timeline is already up-to-date
   - Further optimize for battery
